This project consists primarily of taking 3D objects in 3-space and
projecting them onto the screen using a
[perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection).
The projected objects are then colored using
[flat shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading#Flat_shading).
